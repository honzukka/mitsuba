Mitsuba â€” Procam Fork
===================================

This is a fork of [Mitsuba 0.6](https://www.mitsuba-renderer.org/index_old.html) which features a [thin-lens projector implementation](../master/src/emitters/projector.cpp). Included is also a [Dockerfile](../master/Dockerfile) for easy use.

Here is an example image showing the projector functionality by projecting a photo into a Cornell Box:
